| PERSISTING RECENT SOUNDS AS A FEED                                                              |
===================================================================================================
* If app does not persist sounds, it will have to fetch every single time
* Otherwise, the data fetched will need to live somewhere
* I was thinking at first to just get recent sounds for a date range from N to current time. That
is if I wanted to just display that current list of sounds and not allow the user to see more
beyond that range.
* Another solution would be the typical "feed" like Twitter, where the feed loads a number of
sounds and load more as the user scrolls down the list (pagination)

Some recent queries to use:
* query=""&fields=id,name,tags,username,url,images&filter=created:[NOW-1DAY TO NOW]&sort=created_desc
(current)
* query=""&fields=id,name,username,images&filter=created:[* TO NOW]&sort=created_desc

===================================================================================================
* If user does not log in, then app should still function
* No login page when app starts; add login button or menu option to login
* Notify user when performing a function that requires login
