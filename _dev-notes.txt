* If user does not log in, then app should still function
* No login page when app starts; add login button or menu option to login
* Notify user when performing a function that requires login

| PERSISTING RECENT SOUNDS AS A FEED                                                              |
===================================================================================================
* If app does not persist sounds, it will have to fetch every single time
* Otherwise, the data fetched will need to live somewhere
* I was thinking at first to just get recent sounds for a date range from N to current time. That
is if I wanted to just display that current list of sounds and not allow the user to see more
beyond that range.
* Another solution would be the typical "feed" like Twitter, where the feed loads a number of
sounds and load more as the user scrolls down the list (pagination)

Some recent queries to use:
* query=""&fields=id,name,tags,username,url,images&filter=created:[NOW-1DAY TO NOW]&sort=created_desc
(current)
* query=""&fields=id,name,username,images&filter=created:[* TO NOW]&sort=created_desc

| RECENT SOUNDS LIST AND ADAPTER IMPLEMENTATION                                                   |
===================================================================================================
* The list will include a minimal set of data for each sound (name, username, image, etc.)
* Each item will be clickable and a view will be loaded to display more options for a clicked item
* The list will use endless scrolling to load more sounds when a threshold is passed; will use
pagination
* Will use pull to refresh to load more sounds
* The list will be initialized with sounds once the app is loaded
* Still not sure if this should be the first a user sees since freesound doesn't get that many new
sounds that often (like Twitter feed, for example)
* This list may be part of a tab view
* See above for notes about persisting data for this list. With that in mind, I checked out the
GitHub app and it doesn't seem to persist things like "news". Every time I access this view and
scroll down, it hit a threshold and loads for data.
